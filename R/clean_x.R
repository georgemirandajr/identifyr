#' @title Clean X Numbers
#' @description Useful for correcting manually entered or missing X-numbers that may be abbreviated or contain non-standard methods for handling null values such as "No #"
#' @param x character vector containing X numbers
#' @param using string indicating the name of a reference identifier to compare with. May be one of the following options: "CASE" or "CII".
#' @param value list or character vector that contains the actual values of the known identifier.
#' @details By default, clean_x() simply pads the string containing X numbers and ensures it meets the standard format. This is useful when correcting a small amount of X numbers, or when there is an untrustworthy reference identifier. If a clean case or CII number is available, the X numbers can be cross-referenced to a built-in table using the reference identifier. Only one reference identifier is allowed at the time of the current release.
#' @return Character vector of standardized X numbers. By default, NA values are introduced where there appears to be non-X characters present, unless a match was found in the reference table.
