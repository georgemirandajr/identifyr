# Identifyr 0.1.1

## Release 0.1.1 contains a new function, `obtain_id`, to obtain identifiers when a user supplies one known identifier. An enhancement was made to `clean_x` that allows user to specify whether or not the X number should be cross-referenced with a built-in table. The built-in reference table only contains X-Numbers, Case Numbers (PB) and CII numbers at the time of this release. 

## This latest release contains a known issue with the new function `obtain_id` and the `clean_x` function which are dependent upon the built-in dataset. Currently working to resolve that issue.
