May be one of the following options: \"CASE\" or \"CII\".\n#' @param value list or character vector that contains the actual values of the known identifier.\n#' @details By default, clean_x() simply pads the string containing X numbers and ensures it meets the standard format. This is useful when correcting a small amount of X numbers, or when there is an untrustworthy reference identifier. If a clean case or CII number is available, the X numbers can be cross-referenced to a built-in table using the reference identifier. Only one reference identifier is allowed at the time of the current release.\n#' @return Character vector of standardized X numbers. By default, NA values are introduced where there appears to be non-X characters present, unless a match was found in the reference table.\n#' @seealso clean_pb, clean_id, obtain_id\n#' @examples\n#' clean_x(\"X6789\") # X00006789\n#' clean_x(\"No #\") # NA\n#' clean_x(\"1234\") # X00001234\n#' clean_x(\"X00020\", using = \"CASE\", value = \"PB021665\")\n#' clean_x(\"X00020\", using = \"CII\", value = \"A07515123\")\n\n# X-Number Cleaning\n#' @export\nclean_x <- function(x, using = NULL, value = \"\") {\n\n  # Replace any instances where there is a space anywhere in the X number, such as \"X 0000789\"\n  x <- stringr::str_replace_all(x, pattern = \" \", replacement = \"\")\n\n  padded <- vapply(x, stringr::str_pad, FUN.VALUE = \"character\", width = 9, side = \"left\", pad = \"X\")  # Pad the character vector and assign to a temporary list\n\n  # Replace X's with 0's when there's more than one X in an entry.
