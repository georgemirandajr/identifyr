    "contents" : "# Identifyr 0.1.1\n\n## Release 0.1.1 contains a new function, `obtain_id`, to obtain identifiers when a user supplies one known identifier. An enhancement was made to `clean_x` that allows user to specify whether or not the X number should be cross-referenced with a built-in table. The built-in reference table only contains X-Numbers, Case Numbers (PB) and CII numbers at the time of this release. \n\n",
